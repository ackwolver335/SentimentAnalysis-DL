# 👨‍💻 Sentence Based 📰 Sentiment Analysis - Deep Learning 🗯️

📌 A sentence-level sentiment analysis system built in **Python** using a custom deep learning model inspired by **ResNet** and **GoogleNet** architectures. This project performs sentence-level sentiment analysis using a custom deep learning model built in Python.

The architecture takes inspiration from ResNet and GoogleNet, enabling effective feature extraction from text for classifying sentiments as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

## 📤 Project Description

📄 This project is focused on sentence-based sentiment analysis using a deep learning approach developed entirely in Python. Instead of relying on traditional machine learning models, it introduces a custom neural network architecture inspired by **ResNet** and **GoogleNet**, two of the most powerful models in computer vision — adapted here for **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** tasks.

📃 The model is designed to analyze the sentiment of individual sentences and classify them into one of three categories: **Positive, Negative,** or **Neutral**. Through a combination of convolutional and residual learning concepts, the model efficiently captures semantic patterns and contextual meanings in the input text.

#### 🖥️ Real World Applications ⚙️

➡️ **Customer Feedback Analysis** → Used in **Business Analysis** Reviews in order to improve the products & services, as per customer's feedback.

➡️ **Social Media Monitoring** → In order to analyse **Public's Sentiments** regarding their feeds and **Brands Gauging** over to the Platforms like **Twitter**, **Facebook**, **Instagram**,..etc from their reviews or feedback (Also from the Comments).

➡️ **HealthCare** → Used for Identification of **Patient's Emotions** in feedback in order to enhance care and treatments quality.

➡️ **Market Research** → In order to understand the **Customer's** or **Consumer's** preferences through the survey or feedback responses.

➡️ **Chatbots** → Used for Detection of user's responses while providing responses or requirements in a better or enhanced way.

## 🔖 Demo / Example Output 📮

📄 Providing you the demo example regarding an overview of **" How this Model works ? "**, example is shown below

```bash
python model_test1.py
Text: I'm extremely unhappy with how things turned out.
Predicted Sentiment: NEGATIVE
Confidence Score: 0.99
```

📝 **Remember** : This particular sentiment is analysed using one model only, but as both the model's are good, we could gather a good accuracy with the textual content that we have provided.
